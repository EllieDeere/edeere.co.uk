I studied psychology at Cardiff University between 2014 and 2018, before completing a Masters' degree in Clinical Neuropsychiatry at Kings' College London in 2019.

#### Areas of interest

I am particularly interested in functional neurological disorders and traumatic brain injury. Specifically, neuroinflammation and its relationship with neurological function.
